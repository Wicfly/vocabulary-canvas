# PRD — Vocabulary Canvas (MVP Draft)

A minimal, aesthetic tool for visually learning vocabulary using AI-generated images.

---

## 1. Product Name

**Vocabulary Canvas**

A visual vocabulary board powered by AI-generated imagery.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Traditional vocabulary-learning tools often rely heavily on text and lack visual engagement. For many learners—especially visual thinkers—images significantly improve recall. However, searching for matching images manually is time-consuming. Users need a tool that automatically visualizes the words they are learning and organizes them in an intuitive, beautiful way.

## 3. Target Users

- English learners
- Visual learners
- Designers or creators who enjoy aesthetic tools
- Students building daily vocabulary habits

---

## 4. Core Value Proposition

A playful, creative workspace where users can collect vocabulary, generate AI-based illustrations, and visually arrange their words like stickers on a canvas. This transforms language learning into a more tactile and memorable experience.

---

## 5. Product Overview

The product consists of two interconnected spaces:

### A. Vocabulary Canvas (Noun Canvas)

A blank dot-grid board where noun words appear as draggable visual stickers.

**Each sticker includes:**
- A 2D AI-generated image (e.g., "chair" → chair illustration)
- Tooltip on hover:
  - Word
  - Definition
  - Example sentence (optional MVP+)

Users can rearrange words freely to build a "visual vocabulary landscape."

### B. Vocabulary Gallery (Verb/Adjective/Other Words)

Non-noun words are stored in a book-style gallery.

**Features:**
- AI visualization (abstract or symbolic illustration)
- Pages flip with a smooth book-flip animation
- Each page contains 1–3 words with corresponding images
- A "book on a desk" aesthetic for inspiration

---

## 6. User Stories (MVP)

As a user, I want to…

- Add a new vocabulary word so I can grow my vocabulary collection.
- Generate an image using an AI API (e.g., OpenAI Images, Stability, Replicate) based on my word.
- Place noun images on a canvas and rearrange them freely.
- Hover on an image to see the word and its definition.
- View non-noun words in a separate gallery with page-flip interaction.
- Save my vocabulary board locally (LocalStorage) so I don't lose progress.
